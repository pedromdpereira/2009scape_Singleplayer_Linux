# Getting Started: Linux

* 1: Download or clone this repository.
* 2: After you unpack the .zip (if you just downloaded it) or it finishes cloning (if you cloned it), open up the folder that it created.
* 3: Install java using ` sudo apt-get install default-jre`
* 4: Alter **.gitignore** to save your data removing all the lines there.
* 5: In this folder there will be a **run-linux.sh**, execute this to start everything up.
* 6: What you need to do *first* before you can run the game is initialize the database. You only have to do this once.
* 7: Once that's finished, you can safely run the game with option 1.
